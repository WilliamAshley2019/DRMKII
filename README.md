NOTE it seems this repository was hacked and characters were deleted from the source I don't yet know the extent but there are build errors as a result of a character being missing from many of the lines. I'm not sure why yet.

Currently this is a not so reverby reverb. I am sorting things out on it stay tuned for MKIII.  I havn't quite got this down yet - attenuating a reverb made from stacked filters
is more involved than initially anticipated, some more insight need apply. Currently I CAN get the reverb but I have some filtering issues for the frequency pass.
